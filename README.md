# Goals of this project
- Implement 2 types of discrete fourier transforms (DFT): naive and fast fourier transforms (Cooley-Tukey FFT)
- Understand why one version of the lagorithm is better than the other
- Extend the FFT algorithm to the multidimensional case (2D in this case)
- Use FFT to denoise an image
- Use FFT to compress an image file

# Additional Information
- Written and tested using Python version 3.10.7
